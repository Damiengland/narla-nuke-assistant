# nukescripts.plane_rotation
nukescripts.plane_rotation(_tri_ , _norm =None_)

Calculate the rotations around the X, Y and Z axes in radians that will align a plane perpendicular to the Z axis with the given triangle.
Parameters

**tri** â€“ A list or tuple of 3 _nukemath.Vector3 objects. The 3 points must
describe the plane (i.e. they must not be collinear). :rtype: :return: A _nukemath.Vector3 object where the x coordinate is the angle of rotation around the x axis and so on in radians. :raise ValueError: if the three points are collinear.
