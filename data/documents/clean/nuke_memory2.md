# nuke.memory2
Memory module containing functionality for querying and controlling Nukeâ€™s Memory API, currently the module is named memory2 for backwards compatibility with the old nuke.memory(cmd, value) function which is now deprecated. Once removed this module will be deprecated and it will be renamed to nuke.memory. To avoid future conflicts it is recommended to import like so:
from nuke import memory2 as memory

If the value given is less than the current usage, free memory to the new usage.  Reports the total RAM detected by Nuke.  Reports the total virtual memory (VM) detected by Nuke.
